**ReferenceId** | string | If the transaction was created with the [Charge](#endpoint-charge) endpoint, this value is the same as the value provided for the &#x60;reference_id&#x60; parameter in the request to that endpoint. Otherwise, it is not set. | [optional] 
**Product** | ProductEnum | The Square product that processed the transaction. | [optional]
